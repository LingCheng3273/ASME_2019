Accomplishments:
	Got Arm to work with Motor
	Added more variables for Motor
Problems: 
	Arm() couldn't work with Motor
		Since Motor needs args for constructor, needed to initialize it in function name

Arm library is basic arm fuctions
Arms library is a wrapper class that controls both arms
Arms- wrote checkOpen/checkClose for each arm
	  wrote setup that sets the opening position as the zero position
	  wrote reset that reopens the arms, speed with respect the distance
Plans: 
	Write puesdo code for Motor class
	Test Arm class

Arm library that allows arm to move left, right, open, close, and stop
Stage: functions. Idea: don't need stage class. Put all functions in Arm
Might have to remove functions other than basic from Arm 
	and put open and closing to arms
